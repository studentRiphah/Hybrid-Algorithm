# Hybrid-Algorithm
Hybrid Algorithm (Combining Djikstra and A* Algorithm) 


This repository contains an implementation of a hybrid shortest-path algorithm combining **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A* Search**. The hybrid algorithm aims to dynamically switch between Dijkstra and A* based on the effectiveness of the heuristic function, optimizing pathfinding performance in different scenarios.

## Features
- Combines the reliability of Dijkstra with the efficiency of A*.
- Dynamically switches between Dijkstra and A* based on the heuristic's reliability.
- Designed to solve the shortest path problem in a weighted graph.
- Includes Euclidean distance heuristic for grid-based graphs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
